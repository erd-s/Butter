![Swift](https://github.com/erd-s/Butter/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)

A lightweight networking library.

# Running the Sample

To run the sample change to the ButterSample directory and open ButterSample.xcodeproj.
The sample endpoints point to a local server which can be run by following the instructions in ButterLocalServer/README.md.

You can configure the endpoints to point to whatever you'd like, you may need to make changes to how the data is returned in `setOutputTextViewText(jsonData:)`.
